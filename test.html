<h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
We’re a group of DiscNW Fall Hat rag-tag orphans that came together to form a forever family for Frisbee tournaments in and around the PNW.<br>
<br>
The core team started back in 2015, attending Hanford Howl as "Marvel's Misfits." We proceeded to attend Hanford and Sunbreak nearly every year since. Last year at Sunbreak, we decided to adopt the "Twin Hammers" moniker and we haven't looked back since!

            <b>TWIN HAMMERS IKEA - Hanford Howl 2018</b><br><br>We followed up our nautical adventure paying homage to the Swedish megastore, IKEA. It all started when one of our teammates had a burning desire to dress up as a chair. Other teammates attended as various items related to the IKEA shopping experience (ex: the ubiquitous blue IKEA shopping bag), store employees, customers, foods (ex: IKEA’s famous Swedish meatballs), and the stick figure person featured in the instruction manuals. The highlight of this theme was the spirit game: a day in the IKEA store. Spirit winners were led through an obstacle course race throughout sections of the store to collect materials to construct IKEA furniture from an ambiguous instructions manual.
